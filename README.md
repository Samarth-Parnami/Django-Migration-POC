# Django-Migration-POC
Repository to test different configurations for migration protection.

This repository is to be treated as a full-fleged django application where we can test different configurations of the migration issues.

We can also quickly iterate through workflow changes, for eg: Testing how caching of the pacakges work, how to call another workflow inside another workflow, how to pass config etc.
